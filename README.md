# ANNRL_MP1
The environment considered in this project is the Mountain Car environment implemented in Gymnasium (documentation). A car is placed in a valley at a random location. There are 3 possible actions: accelerate to the left, accelerate to the right, do nothing. We provide an introduction to interacting with the Mountain Car environment in the tutorial notebook. The goal is to reach the top of the right hill. The car is underpowered, so it needs to gain momentum by going back and forth before being able to reach the goal. The reward at each step is -1 except when the goal is reached where it is 0. The main challenge of this environment is the sparse reward function. Before finding the goal for the first time, the car will have no clue on what to do. We will see how this issue can be tackled.
